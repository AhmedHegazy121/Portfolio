How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

***To answer these questions, we will delve into the following topics:**

- Duration and frequency of rides: We will analyze data to understand the typical length of rides for both user groups. Are there noticeable differences between casual riders and members? Are members using the bikes more frequently or for longer duration?

- Ride timings: We’ll investigate if there’s a difference in the time of day, day of the week, or month of the year when the two user groups typically use the bikes.

- Bike preferences: Given that Cyclistic offers various bike options, we will examine if there’s a pattern in the type of bike preferred by the two user groups.

Answering these questions will provide insights into the riding patterns of the two groups (annual member and casual renters), and will be instrumental in forming the foundation for a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The strategy will be developed in alignment with these insights, addressing the unique needs and behaviors of casual riders to motivate their transition to becoming annual members.

Cyclistic’s collected data forms the backbone of this analysis. For transparency, we have included the source code in the paper’s Appendix. We strive to communicate our findings clearly, pairing concise language with comprehensible visualizations and straightforward recommendations.

### [Comprehensive Guide to SQL Server Indexing and Optimization Techniques](https://github.com/AhmedHegazy121/portfolioProjects/blob/main/Overall%20Indexes.sql)

**Index Types and Use Cases**
- Heap Tables: Suitable for staging tables without any indexes; offers fast inserts but poor query performance.
- Clustered Index: Best for OLTP systems and primary keys or date columns; organizes data rows physically.
- Non-Clustered Index: Ideal for filtering and join operations; works on non-primary key columns.
- Columnstore Index: Optimal for OLAP workloads, analytics, and aggregations with efficient storage and fast read performance.
- Filtered Index: Targets specific subsets of data for improved efficiency.
- Unique Index: Ensures data uniqueness while boosting read performance.

**Index Management**
- Creating, Monitoring, and Dropping Indexes:
- The script demonstrates creating clustered, non-clustered, columnstore, and unique indexes.
- It includes commands to monitor index usage, fragmentation, and identify missing or duplicate indexes using system DMVs.
- Example: Use sp_helpindex or sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats for real-time index insights.

**Query Performance Enhancement**
- Execution Plan Analysis:
Differentiates between Table Scan, Index Scan, and Index Seek, highlighting the importance of proper indexing.
Encourages examining actual execution plans to validate index usage and identify bottlenecks.
- SQL Hints:
Demonstrates controlling query behavior (e.g., forcing join algorithms, index usage) for performance fine-tuning.

**Maintenance and Optimization**
- Statistics Updates:
Ensures accurate query optimization by scheduling statistics updates.
Covers manual updates for specific tables, indexes, or entire databases using sp_updatestats.
- Fragmentation Management:
Recommends actions based on fragmentation percentage: Reorganize (<30%) or Rebuild (>30%).
Commands to evaluate and address fragmentation using sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats.

**Advanced Scenarios**
- Columnstore Index Benefits:
Showcases significant space savings and aggregation performance improvements for analytics.
- Join Optimization:
Explores join algorithms (Nested Loops, Hash Match, Merge Join) with guidance on their best use cases.

### [Using Partition Function](https://github.com/AhmedHegazy121/portfolioProjects/blob/main/Partition%20Function.sql)
This project showcases my ability to implement table partitioning in SQL Server to optimize query performance and manage large datasets effectively.

**Steps**
- I defined a partition function named partitionByYear(Date) to segment data into partitions based on year boundaries. I also verified the existing partition functions using sys.partition_functions.
- I created four filegroups (FG_2023, FG_2024, FG_2025, FG_2026) to logically organize the partitions and checked the created filegroups using sys.filegroups.
- To store partition data, I added secondary .ndf files (P_2023.ndf, P_2024.ndf, P_2025.ndf, P_2026.ndf) to the respective filegroups. The details of the files and their paths were verified using a query joining sys.filegroups and sys.master_files.
- I set up a partition scheme named schemePartitionByYear to map partitions to the appropriate filegroups according to the defined partition function. I validated the scheme and its mappings using sys.partition_schemes.
- I set up a partition scheme named schemePartitionByYear to map partitions to the appropriate filegroups according to the defined partition function. I validated the scheme and its mappings using sys.partition_schemes.
- I verified that records were correctly stored in their respective partitions by querying partition-specific metadata from system views like sys.partitions and sys.filegroups.
- Finally, I compared the performance of the partitioned table with a non-partitioned version (Sales.Orders_Nopartittioned). By querying data based on OrderDate, I demonstrated the efficiency of partitioned queries, where fewer rows were read compared to non-partitioned queries.

**Here's an explanation of the steps taken in your code:**

Reading the CSV File: The code reads a CSV file named New.csv into a pandas DataFrame named df, which contains data about cricket players and their performance statistics.

Renaming Columns: Several columns are renamed to more descriptive names, such as "Mat" to "matches_played", "Inns" to "innings_batted", "NO" to "not_outs", etc., for better readability and understanding of the data.

Checking for Null Values: The code checks for any null values in the DataFrame and finds that several columns contain null values.

Handling Missing Values: Specifically, the code identifies that the "balls_faced" and "batting_strike_rate" columns contain null values for some players. It fills these null values with 0 to handle missing data appropriately.

Dropping Duplicate Rows: The code identifies and drops duplicate rows in the DataFrame to ensure that each player is represented only once in the dataset.

Splitting the Span Column: The "Span" column, which contains the years a player was active, is split into two separate columns, "Rooki_year" and "final_year", representing the start and end years of the player's career.

Dropping Unnecessary Columns: The original "Span" column is dropped from the DataFrame as it has been replaced by the new "Rooki_year" and "final_year" columns.

Dropping a Specific Row: Finally, the code drops a row with index 67, which contains NaN values in all columns, to clean up the DataFrame further and ensure no irrelevant data remains.
